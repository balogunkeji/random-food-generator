## Steps for writing an acceptable commit msg

- although `git commit -m "message here"` is not advisable, we will use it for the sake of speed and the bias that its a small project
- in your msg answer this questions

1. Why is your change necessary
2. how does it address the issue
3. What side effect does your change have

**you changes might not always be inline with the above just make sure you add a good commit message**

**an example of a commit msg**
`git commit -m "make button red for accessiblity of people with poor sight"`
